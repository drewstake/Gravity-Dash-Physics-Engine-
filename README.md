# Gravity Dash (Physics Engine)

Gravity Dash is a 2D physics-based game developed using C++ and raylib. The game features realistic gravity, friction, and collision mechanics. Players control a ball to collect stars while avoiding obstacles. The game includes dynamic level progression with increasing difficulty.

## Features
- Realistic physics simulation with gravity and friction.
- Dynamic level progression with procedurally generated obstacles and collectible stars.
- Smooth player controls and engaging gameplay mechanics.
- Sound effects for interactions and level progression.
- Optimized for consistent frame rates and performance.
